## About

EasyPoll uses the window location as a unique referrer and can be dropped onto any webpage as a simple polling tool or can be adapted to create more dymamic polling experiences.  If you are interested in Node.js and MongoDB application solutions then EasyPoll will get you started.

## Lightweight

I have deliberately tried to keep the application as bare bones as possible to allow rapid development, Mocha tests are included, views are pretty basic, I have added a light Bootstrap touch for styling and a little JavaScript to access localStorage on the client-side.

## Platform

[mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/)
